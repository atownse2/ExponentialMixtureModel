    "# Abstract\n",
    "Searches for new physics at the LHC often involve looking for excesses on top of falling backgrounds. Typical approaches model the background using polynomials or other parametric families. Polynomials are nice because they theoretically provide unbiased estimates of the background, however they can lead to undesirable behavior in the tails. Parametric families can be found which provide accurate estimates but are often ad-hoc and can lead to biased estimates. To address these biases one typically considers several parametric families at once to estimate the systematic uncertainty. In this work we motivate the use of the exponential mixture model to estimate long tailed distributions. The exponential mixture model is unique in representation and can approximate any completely monotonic function to arbitrary precision. We show that the model gives comparable performance to other methods in data and in toy studies that it is flexible enough to approximate many commonly used parametric families."

    "Searches for new physics often employ a statistical framework which consists of a signal and a background model. In most cases the standard model backgrounds are complicated enough that there is no analytic form for the background. In some cases the best thing to do is to use a non-parametric approach, deriving the background from Monte Carlo simulations of the standard model processes and detector response. In such cases it's not always clear that one is including all the relevant processes and validation of the method comes from cross-checks performed in data. In other cases people choose to use a parametric approach, modeling the background with some analytic function. The advantage of this approach is that it is often easier to implement as we do not need to worry about the details of the simulation, this is especially true when the background is not well understood. The disadvantage is that we need to choose a functional form and this choice can lead to biases which can be difficult to quantify. In this work we will focus on the case of a falling background, which is the most common case in high mass searches. We will show that the hyperexponential model is a good choice for modeling falling backgrounds and that it has several advantages over other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "One commonly used analytic form for the background is a polynomial. Polynomials are nice because of their theoretical properties which guarantee that they are unbiased estimates of the background. However, polynomials can lead to undesirable behavior in the tails where they can diverge to infinity after running out of data. Any deviation from a falling background could be evidence of new physics so it would be nice to have a model which incorporates some physics intuition. Other approaches involve using some parametric family of functions which are not necessarily unbiased but lack the undesirable flexibility of polynomials. The functions used are often ad-hoc and are derived from backgrounds specific to a given analysis. The bias is usually quantified by considering several parametric families at once, in a method known as discrete profiling or the envelope method."

    "Mixture models are effective tools for modeling mixed effects and approximating more complicated distributions. A simple example is a weighted sum of two normal distributions which uses the normal distribution as the base density function and a categorical distribution (with two categories) as the mixing distribution for the normal means.

For the most part I'd say this suggests over-parameterization - if the parameters are the same it means that there are no residuals which are improved by having an additional parameter. Is a bounded parameter less likely to go to zero - probably so for Minuit because it uses some transformation which has trouble with parameters on the boundaries - I think the unbound parameter needs to go to infinity to reach the boundary. But the rate difference doesn't need to be zero for them to be close enough to describe the same effect - there is uncertainty in all the parameters anyway. I wonder, is this ordered parameterization less likely to get stuck in this $r_i\\approx r_j$ mode.\n",

I could multiply my pdf by $\\prod e^{-b/\\alpha_j}$, but then what choice of $b$ is appropriate? It should probably depend on the scale of the rate parameters."
